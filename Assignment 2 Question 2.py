"""
Write a program that will repeatedly take (for a student) input of this 
type: course_no, number_of_credits, and grade_received (eg. CSE101 4 A). 
These inputs are for the courses the student has done in the semester. 
If no input is given (i.e. just a return), that means no courses are left. 
From this data, print the transcript for the semester for the student as:

Course_no: grade
Course_no: grade
â€¦

SGPA: n.nn  (two decimal places)

In the transcript, the records should be printed such that they are sorted by the 
course_no (hint: when sorting a list of tuples/lists, the default sorting is with the first 
element of the tuple/list).

The course numbers are an alphanumeric string with capital letters in the start and digits 
at the end (e.g. CSE101, CSSS21), credits can be 1, 2 or 4, and grade can be 
A+ (10), A(10), A-(9), B(8), B-(7), C(6), C-(5), D(4), F(2) 
(the number in () is their numeric equivalent for SGPA calculation.) 
The SGPA is computed as (sum of:  credits*grade/ total_credits). 
If any input is not valid, print a suitable message 
("improper course no", "incorrect credit", or "incorrect grade") and ignore that input.  

Suggestions: A list of tuples/lists may be a good structure to use. 
Read the input as tuples into a list. When inputs are done, process the list. 
First just write code to read the input, split it into a list, 
and pass it to a function to check for errors 
(recall string has operations like isdigit() to check if the string is integer). 
If input is valid, add to a list of tuples 
(initially, to check the course name structure just check if it is an alphanumeric string
- later write a function to check its valid structure - requires a bit of logic). 
Independently write a function which, given a list of tuples, can compute the SGPA. 
Then combine the two.
